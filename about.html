        <h1>About Me: Robee D.</h1>
        <p>I'm currently a high school senior at Dr. Richard A. Vladovic Harbor Teacher Preparation Academy (VHTPA for short). Through this school, I am able to participate in a dual enrollment program, where I can take courses at Los Angeles Harbor College. I've had a strong interest in cybersecurity since middle school, and engaged myself in autodidactic experiences that helped me explore new horizons within this field.</p>
