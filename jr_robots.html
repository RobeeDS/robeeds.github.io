            <h1>Exploring Computer Science Culminating Project: Game Development</h1>
            <p>During the second semester of my exploring computer science course, my teacher assigned a game development project. My partner <a href="https://github.com/Darkvirgo15" target="_blank">@DVLS</a> and I decided that it was best for us to push ourselves and develop a game through C#, due to its simplicity, power, and flexibility. We first decided to work with Unity Engine, as the new physics features were recently released. With a deadline within one month, we had to create a three-stage game with a unique plot, animated objects, with all of it starting from scratch. Here, you'll find the documented journey we took on creating our game, <a id="download" href="#">Jr. Robots</a></p>
